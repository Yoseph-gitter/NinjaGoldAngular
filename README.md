# NinjaGoldAngular

This project is about how a "Ninja" entity plays a game by going to the different playing locations which he gets different prises in this case 
is a GOLD with a specified amount.
The application keeps track of the total Gold Amount Ninja acquires until now.
we used two angular components for the game. First component is where the Ninja clicks the different locations and stores the total Gold earned.
The Second COMPONENT is the activity log of the ninja

Here , we used @Input and @output decorators to pass around ninja gold informatins

There is also this root-component that encapsulates both components.

Next pase of this learning project is : making it such that it can be played for multiple users.
